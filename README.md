# SolPlay DemoGen - Solution Play Demo Generator

## Overview
Intelligent platform that automatically reads Financial Services solution play PDFs, extracts Hero AI use cases, and generates interactive, demoable solutions using ARIA v4's 8-role AI development team.

## ðŸš€ Phase 1 - MVP Demo (Current Focus)

**Phase 1 Goal**: Build a working demo for ONE Hero AI use case with synthetic data and local file storage.

**Selected Use Case (Initial)**: **Content Generation - RFP Response Automation**
- Input: Financial Services solution play PDF
- Output: AI-generated RFP response demonstration
- Storage: Local file system (no cloud requirements)
- Security: Synthetic data only (no security focus)

### Quick Start (Phase 1)

#### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- OpenAI API key
- Git

#### Installation & Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rajesh-ms/hackathon-solplay-demogen.git
cd hackathon-solplay-demogen

# Navigate to Phase 1 implementation
cd phase1

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OPENAI_API_KEY

# Start the Phase 1 demo
npm run dev
```

#### Running Phase 1 Demo
```bash
# Start backend server (http://localhost:3001)
npm run start:backend

# Open frontend in browser (http://localhost:3000)
# Upload the sample PDF from synthetic-data/ folder
# Watch as the system extracts use cases and generates RFP response demo
```

### Phase 1 Features Demonstrated
- âœ… **PDF Upload & Parsing**: Simple web interface for PDF upload
- âœ… **AI Use Case Extraction**: OpenAI-powered extraction of RFP response capabilities
- âœ… **Demo Generation**: Automatic creation of RFP response demonstrations
- âœ… **Synthetic Data**: Sample solution plays and RFP scenarios
- âœ… **Local Storage**: File system based storage (no cloud dependencies)
 - âœ… **(NEW) Enhanced Market Research & Analytics**: AI agent combines local extracted data with live (or synthetic fallback) web search to produce structured research insights

### Enhanced Market Research & Analytics (New Use Case)
This feature demonstrates an AI research analyst agent that:
1. Loads locally stored extracted solution play or RFP data (previous uploads)
2. Performs an external web search (Bing Web Search API or SerpAPI if keys provided, otherwise synthetic fallback)
3. Synthesizes comparative insights, opportunities, risks, and recommended actions
4. Persists a structured research report JSON for retrieval and further demo usage

#### API Endpoints
POST `/api/market-research/analyze`
Request body:
```json
{
    "topic": "enhanced market research in capital markets",
    "localDataIds": ["<processingId1>", "<processingId2>"],
    "maxWebResults": 5
}
```
Alternative: supply rawLocalData instead of localDataIds:
```json
{
    "topic": "AI driven market surveillance",
    "rawLocalData": [
        { "title": "Internal Capability Deck", "content": "Our platform ingests multi-venue trading feeds..." }
    ]
}
```
Response:
```json
{
    "success": true,
    "report": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "topic": "...",
        "comparativeInsights": ["..."],
        "opportunities": ["..."],
        "risks": ["..."],
        "recommendedActions": ["..."],
        "webFindings": [ { "title": "...", "url": "...", "snippet": "..." } ],
        "meta": { "provider": "bing|serpapi|dummy", "syntheticFallback": false }
    }
}
```

GET `/api/market-research/:id`
Returns the stored research report JSON.

#### Environment Variables
Add to `.env` (optional, improves realism):
```
BING_SEARCH_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SERPAPI_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-.... (already used by existing AI processor)
```
If no search keys are present, a deterministic synthetic ("dummy") provider returns plausible placeholder findings; if no OpenAI key, a heuristic synthetic insight generator is used.

#### File Output
Reports stored under `phase1/data/market-research/<id>.json` with structure defined by `ResearchReport` interface.

#### Future Enhancements (Not yet implemented)
- Entity-level citation mapping and confidence scoring
- Time-series aggregation of repeated research runs
- Vector store enrichment for improved local contextualization
- Frontend UI to browse & compare reports
